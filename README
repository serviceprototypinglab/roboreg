====================================================================

Purpose
-------

Roboreg gives owners or tenants of robots the ability to check their
status, use their services, and deploy and run software applications.

Roboreg uses Salt as underlying device coupling infrastructure. The
service functionality will be provided by ROS nodes present on the
robots.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

This project requires Salt version 2016.3. The non-API parts should work with
the older 2014.1. Salt will have to be patched (apply salt-netapi.diff) as
otherwise the master will not be found by the API.
Install Salt and (optionally) deactivate the system-wide daemons to rather
control your own instances:
 $ apt-get install salt-master salt-minion salt-api
 $ update-rc.d salt-master disable; systemctl stop salt-master  # optional
 $ update-rc.d salt-minion disable; systemctl stop salt-minion  # optional
 $ sudo patch /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/salt/netapi/__init__.py salt/salt-netapi.diff

Copy roboreg.ini.dist to roboreg.ini and configure it accordingly.

Launch in the following order (on separate terminals), if not already done:
 $ ./salt/launch-salt-master.sh
 $ ./salt/launch-salt-minion.sh
 $ salt-key -c salt/config --accept $HOSTNAME

Test the functionality:
 $ ./test-scripts/salt-command.sh ls
 $ ./test-scripts/salt-roscommand.sh

To make use of the Roboreg registry, launch in addition:
 $ ./salt/launch-salt-api.sh

Again, test the functionality (you should NOT see an unauthorized status).
Then, run the client:
 $ ./test-scripts/api-call-http.sh
 $ ./roboreg show

The output of Roboreg is as follows:
 Robot minionhost / t=1465385020 / h=adbbc3 [  *]
       ^name($HN.)  ^timestamp     ^hash    ^liveliness

Notice how mutual exclusion is realised with "roboreg show $HOSTNAME".

Try function chaining to apply an operation to a selection:
 $ ./roboreg pick "camera=True" » call test

Use the embedded service gateway: http://localhost:11000/?camera=True.

Source the syntax auto-completion in bash:
 $ . roboreg.bashcompletion
Alternatively, copy the file permanently to /etc/bash_completion.d/.
